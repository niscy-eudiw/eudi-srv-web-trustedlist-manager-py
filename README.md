## Overview

A Trusted List Provider (TLP) is a body responsible for maintaining, managing, and publishing a Trusted List.
Within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem, Trusted Lists exist for the following entities:
+ Wallet Providers,
+ PID Providers,
+ QEAA Providers,
+ PuB-EAA Providers,
+ Access Certificate Authorities (for RP),
+ Qualified Electronic Signature Remote Creation (QESRC) Providers.

Trusted Lists contain the trust anchors of the relevant entities. A trust anchor is a combination of a public key and the identifier of the associated entity and may be used to verify signatures created by that entity.

An **entity's status as a trusted entity can be verified by checking whether they are present on the relevant Trusted List**.

### Trusted Lists (TL) and EU List of Trusted Lists (EU LoTL)

The **TL** includes information related to the trust service providers (within the EUDI Wallet ecosystem: Wallet Providers, PID Providers, QEAA Providers, PuB-EAA Providers, Access Certificate Authorities (for RP), and Qualified Electronic Signature Remote Creation (QESRC) Providers) which are supervised by the competent Member State, together with the trust anchor and other information related to the trust services provided by them.
+ A TL is created, electronically signed, published and managed by a Member State.

The **EU LOTL** combines all national Trusted Lists into a single, easily accessible list, simplifying the verification of digital identities across Member States.
+ The EU LOTL is created, electronically signed, published and managed by the EC.

The source of trust of the TLs is the EU List of the Trusted Lists (LOTL). And the source of trust for the LOTL is the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)
+ LOTL signing certificates and the location of the LOTL XML file are contained in the LOTL itself, as detailed in the OJEU publication.

### List of Trusted Entities (LoTE) - ETSI TS 119 602 V1.1.1 (2025-11)

List of Trusted Entities are intended to convey trust in a set of entities that are providing services within a given approval scheme. They take the form of a list of entities that have been granted a particular status under the given approval scheme.
They represent the outcome of a process of approval, whereby the listed entities are assessed as being trustworthy for the services they provide and granted a particular status corresponding to this level of trustworthiness.

### Reference Implementation Trusted List Provider

The Reference Implementation Trusted List Provider has the following features:

+ Users:
  + TSL Operator - Member States
  + LoTL Operator - EC
+ Functionalities for TSL Operators:
  + Manage TSPs, TEs and their services
  + Create and sign TLs and LoTE
+ Functionalities for LoTL Operators:
  + Create and sign LoTL (combining the TL created by the Member States)

## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Disclaimer

The released software is a initial development release version:

-   The initial development release is an early endeavor reflecting the efforts of a short timeboxed
    period, and by no means can be considered as the final product.
-   The initial development release may be changed substantially over time, might introduce new
    features but also may change or remove existing ones, potentially breaking compatibility with your
    existing code.
-   The initial development release is limited in functional scope.
-   The initial development release may contain errors or design flaws and other problems that could
    cause system or other failures and data loss.
-   The initial development release has reduced security, privacy, availability, and reliability
    standards relative to future releases. This could make the software slower, less reliable, or more
    vulnerable to attacks than mature software.
-   The initial development release is not yet comprehensively documented.
-   Users of the software must perform sufficient engineering and additional testing in order to
    properly evaluate their application and determine whether any of the open-sourced components is
    suitable for use in that application.
-   We strongly recommend not putting this version of the software into production use.
-   Only the latest version of the software will be supported

##  JAdES Signature 

In this project, to sign the LoTE in JSON format, it must be signed using a compact JAdES Baseline B signature. The Wallet-driven external SCA component (https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-web-walletdriven-signer-external-sca-java) is used for this purpose.
The URL where the Wallet-driven external SCA is defined:
+ in app/app_config/config.py as sca_signer_url
+ in docker/docker-compose.yml as SCA_SIGNER_URL

## Installation
1. Enter the folder

  ```shell
  cd eudi-srv-web-trustedlist-manager-py
  ```

2. Create .venv to install flask and other libraries

  Windows:
  
  ```shell
  python -m venv .venv 
  ```
  
  Linux:

  ```shell
  python3 -m venv .venv
  ```

3. Activate the environment

  windows:
    
  ```shell
  . .venv\Scripts\Activate
  ```
    
  Linux:
  
  ```shell
  . .venv/bin/activate
  ```
    
  4. Install the necessary libraries to run the code

  ```shell
  pip install -r app/requirements.txt
  ```

  5. Run the Project
  ```shell
  flask --app app run
  ```

## Run

  ### 1. Database
  1. Change app/app_config/database.py to your DB settings

  2. Populate "countries" Table with at least one country. Recommended: 
  
  ```shell     
  INSERT INTO countries (country_id, country_code, country_name) VALUES (1, 'FC', 'Fake Country');
  ```
  ### 2. Initial Page

  Initial Page of the Trusted Lists Registration Service (<http://127.0.0.1:5000/> or <http://localhost:5000/>) :
  + AUTH: <http://localhost:5000/authentication>

  There are two ways to use it:

  + With 1 user -> 1 user has access to both menus.
  + With 2 users (TSL user and TSP user) -> each user only has access to their corresponding menu.

  To switch between these two modes, simply go to the file "config.py" inside "app_config", and look for the "two_operators" option.
  
  + "False" -> 1 user
  + "True"  -> 2 users
  + Note: By default, the option is set to "False".

  ### 3. Menu - Scheme Operator Trusted List user
